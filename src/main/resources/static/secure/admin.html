    "description": "While the Surbiton Food Festival has ensured that most are now aware of the town’s awesome capacity for food, fun, and festivity, many still fail to appreciate the incredible level of sporting prowess found among the townspeople. From the incredible athleticism and dexterity of our three legged racers, to the ice cool composure of our egg-and-spoonists, all the way to the head-turning aesthetic beauty of our male Drag Racers, the FREE Seething Community Sports Day gives the public the chance to witness sporting elegance and achievement within a charming local atmosphere. With each event ultimately dictating which of the village’s ancient guilds are declared the Seething Sports Stars – culminating in a spectacular town-wide Tug O’ War – anyone can come along and join in. Cheesemakers, Water Carriers, Taxidermists, or Talcum Miners –  who will reign supreme?
    Sports events are complemented by the obligatory brilliant stalls, entertainment, and bar, while the Fun Dog Show presents canines the opportunity to enter the spirit of friendly competition.",

    "description": "Free!
    A celebration of the enormous diversity offered by our local community. With stalls dotted across St Andrew’s Square, punters have the freedom to sample almost any food they can think of, with a strong musical line up of local bands and artists providing the soundtrack. Meanwhile a wide range of businesses, from Pizza Express to Naturally Chinese, will be running demonstrations and workshops for adults and children, while everyone has a means of getting involved through the huge range of culinary competitions listed within.
    Of course we couldn’t have all of this without the finest brewers in town having their say. The Lamb, The Antelope, and The Black Lion have joined forces to deliver London’s only Dry Hopped Beer Festival, serving a beautiful range of ales, all from CAMRA-recognised Local Suppliers and with all profits going to charity.",

    From there a procession led by the four giant guinea pigs of Seething will lead the crowd to Claremont Gardens where a BBQ and entertainment will take place and more Seething visitors can join in the fun and heritage.",
